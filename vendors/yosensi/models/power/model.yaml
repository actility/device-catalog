# Commercial name of the model 
name: YO Power
# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters. 
description: "YO Power measures AC current flowing through devices connected to the mains. It can be fitted with up to six current clamps. One YO Power device can measure multiple currents simultaneously (e.g. in one three-phase device, two three-phase devices, six single-phase devices, three single-phase devices, etc.)."
