# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters.
description: The MClimate 16A Dry Switch LoRaWAN® is a miniature device that features a dry 16A relay. The device is small enough to fit behind most wall switches and power equipment, enabling you to automate, track, and control your electrical appliances. The device has 4 terminals L, N, I, O, connecting and disconnecting I from O. The 16А Dry Switch features an overheating protection mechanism, operates in LoRaWAN Class C, and as all other MClimate devices supports FUOTA (Firmware Upgrades Over The Air).

examples:
  mclimate:16a-dry-switch:1:
    - internal temperature positive, relay ON
    - internal temperature positive, relay OFF
    - internal temperature negative (sign bit set), relay ON
    - device versions (0x04) + keepalive trailer
    - keepAliveTime (0x12) + keepalive trailer
    - joinRetryPeriod (0x19) where 0x3C -> 5 minutes + keepalive trailer
    - watchdog params (0x1d) + keepalive trailer
    - overheating thresholds (0x1f) + keepalive trailer
    - FUOTA address (0xa0) + region (0xa4) + keepalive trailer
    - too short payload -> decoder throws 'Unhandled data'
    - setKeepAlive (0x02)
