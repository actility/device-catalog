# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters.
description: The MClimate 16A Dry Switch LoRaWAN® is a miniature device that features a dry 16A relay. The device is small enough to fit behind most wall switches and power equipment, enabling you to automate, track, and control your electrical appliances. The device has 4 terminals L, N, I, O, connecting and disconnecting I from O. The 16А Dry Switch features an overheating protection mechanism, operates in LoRaWAN Class C, and as all other MClimate devices supports FUOTA (Firmware Upgrades Over The Air).
