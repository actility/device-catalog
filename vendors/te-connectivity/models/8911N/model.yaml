# Commercial name of the model
name: 8911N
# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters.
description: The TE model 8911EX wireless vibration sensor combines a single axis accelerometer, a bundled DSP (FFT peak search), a data collector, and a radio into one compact, battery operated device that measures both vibration and temperature data. It was designed for hash environment and comes with the ATEX certification.
