# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters.
description: "The dnt LoRaWAN® Wall Thermostat (dnt-lw-wth) controls the heating or air conditioning of the room. It measures the room temperature and humidity and shows it on the integrated Display. For automatic adjustment of the room temperature, the user can configure three profiles with each up to ten temperature changes a day. Other features are the window-open detection, a holiday mode, an energy-saving mode and various configuration options through LoRaWAN downlinks. Through our low power design, the device consumes only 45 uA in default mode, which results in a battery lifetime of up to 5 years."
