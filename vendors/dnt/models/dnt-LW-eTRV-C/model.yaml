# Commercial name of the model
name: LoRaWAN® Radiator Thermostat Controllable
# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters.
description: "The dnt® LoRaWAN® Radiator thermostat Controllable (dnt-lw-eTRV-C) enables two ways to adjust the room temperature: directly on the device with the integrated buttons or remote control via Downlinks. It features an always-on e-paper display to show the current temperature settings, three customizable heating profiles with up to ten switching times per day, a window open detection to automatically reduce temperature and the possibility to perform a dynamic adaptive adjustment of the radiator. Because of very low energy consumption, a battery life up to 3 years can be archived."
