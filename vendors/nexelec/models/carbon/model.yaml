# Commercial name of the model 
name: Carbon
# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters. 
description: "Carbon measures the CO2 level and continuously monitors air quality to visually alert occupants when it is time to ventilate to renew indoor air. With its temperature and humidity sensors, Carbon also analyzes the ambient parameters of the building. Carbon integrates the iZiAiR air quality and hygrothermal comfort algorithm to easily study each indoor environment and identify possible improvements. Thanks to its wireless communication module, data can be accessed remotely, simply from a smartphone or a computer screen"
