# Commercial name of the model
name: CM sensor
# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters.
description: The CM sensor is a magnetic contact sensor capable of detecting opening or closures of object such as doors and windows. The compact design of this sensor make it ideal to use indoor in homes and officess. This sensor features a very low battery consuption, allowing this sensor to last several years without battery replacement. This sensor is LoRaWAN 1.0.2 compliant.
