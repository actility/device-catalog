# Formal driver name
name: Innotas Modularis water meter attachment driver
# Simple description of the driver functionalities
description: The water meter attachment was developed for counters with a Modularis system shaft. The mechanical counter is scanned on an inductive basis. LoRaWANÂ® was implemented as the radio technology.Since the water meter is battery-operated and should have a service life of 10 years, the transmission frequency was limited to one transmission every 2 -4 hours, which is sufficient for a consumption billing.
# Mandatory - id of the company that developed the driver
# This id will be used to construct the id of the driver (Should be in lowercase, no special characters, maximum 8 characters)
producerId: innotas
# Email of the developer
developerEmail: sieber@innotas-elektronik.de
# In case of a driver per model: `<vendorId>:<protocolName>:<protocolVersion>`
# In case of one driver for all models: `<vendorId>:generic:<protocolVersion>`
# Needed for linking the model with a specific driver -> must be the same one used in model.yaml in the corresponding model
# You should have only one protocolId per driver
protocolId: innotas:water-meter:1
# This is to specify the type of functions signature used in this driver. Possible values: actility, lora-alliance, ttn, chirpstack.
# Keep it empty if you followed the lora-alliance payload codec api
signature: chirpstack
