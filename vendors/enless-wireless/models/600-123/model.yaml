# Commercial name of the model 
name: TX CO2 / T&H AMB 600-123
# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters. 
description: "The levels of CO2 is the main indicator of the air quality breathed by the building occupants. This data has a direct influence on the daily comfort of the occupants in enclosed spaces, and can trigger issues such as fatigue, drowsiness, and headaches. Designed for measuring air quality in tertiary environments, the LoRa(WAN) Enless air quality sensor allows you to monitor CO2 (ppm), temperature, and humidity values in the building."
