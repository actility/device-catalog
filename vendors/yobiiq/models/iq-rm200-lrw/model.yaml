# Commercial name of the model
name: RM200 - Digital Output Relay Module
# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters.
description: The YOBIIQ RM200 makes it possible to control digital outputs by utilizing remote automation, We have developed the iQ Digital Controller with 2 fully isolated, seperate relays. Each relay is capable of switching up to a 10A 230V AC. Using the override buttons on the device you are able to control the relay output regardless of the network connection.
