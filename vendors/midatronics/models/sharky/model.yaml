# Commercial name of the model 
name: Sharky
# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters. 
description: "The Midatronics Sharky PCB is an IoT-certified module with an onboard PCB antenna based on the ST Microelectronics STM32WB55CEU6 system on chip, a highly integrated low power radio design with two cores in a single SoC. There is an ARM Cortex-M4 32-bit microprocessor to run your application and one ARM Cortex-M0+ 32-bit microprocessor running the radio networking Stack. The Sharky module supports BLE, Thread, ZigBee, and generic IEEE 802.15.4 protocol stacks."
