# Commercial name of the model 
name: MKR WINDY
# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters. 
description: "The Midatronics MKR WINDY is an Arduino MKR1000 form factor board based on the Midatronics WINDY Module, an IoT module with onboard uFL connector based on the ST Microelectronics STM32WL, System-On-Chip integrates both a general-purpose microcontroller and a sub-GHz radio on the same chip. Built on an Arm® Cortex®‐M4 core architecture, STM32WL microcontrollers support multiple modulations – LoRa®, (G)FSK, (G)MSK, and BPSK."
