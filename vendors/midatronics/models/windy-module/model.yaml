# Commercial name of the model 
name: Windy Module
# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters. 
description: "The Midatronics Windy Module is based on the ST Microelectronics STM32WL, System-On-Chip integrates both a general-purpose microcontroller and a sub-GHz radio on the same chip. Built on an Arm® Cortex®‐M4 core architecture, STM32WL microcontrollers also support multiple modulations – LoRa®, (G)FSK, (G)MSK, BPSK – to ensure flexibility in wireless applications with LoRaWAN®, Sigfox® or any other suitable protocol in a fully open way."
