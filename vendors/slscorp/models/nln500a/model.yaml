# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters. 
description: "The NebuLink Node NLN500a is the First and Smallest STM32WL Based LoRa Module. It is built on the STM32WL SoC which has an Embedded LoRaWAN Transceiver for a wide range of Smart Applications. It offers long-range, low-power, and secure data transmission for M2M and IoT applications. This Module is designed to be extremely low-power and is based on the high-performance STM32WLE5JC Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 48 MHz. This core implements a full set of DSP instructions and an independent memory protection unit (MPU) that enhances the application security."
