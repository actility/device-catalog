# Commercial name of the model
name: WS202 PIR & Light Sensor
# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters.
description: Milesight WS202 is a LoRa PIR sensor based on passive infrared technology to detect a motion or occupancy. WS202 can detect whether there is movement within the range of 6-8 m and send the changes via LoRaWAN® network. Besides, WS202 equips with light sensor which can link PIR detection results to trigger scenes. With compact size and powered battery, WS202 is easy to install everywhere.
