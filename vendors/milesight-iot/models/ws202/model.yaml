# Commercial name of the model 
name: Milesight WS202 PIR & Light Sensor
# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters. 
description: Milesight WS202 is a LoRa PIR sensor based on passive infrared technology to detect a motion or occupancy. WS202 can detect whether there is movement within the range of 6-8 m and send the changes via LoRaWANÂ® network. Besides, WS202 equips with light sensor which can link PIR detection results to trigger scenes. With compact size and powered battery, WS202 is easy to install everywhere.
