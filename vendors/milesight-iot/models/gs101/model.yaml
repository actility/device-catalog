# Commercial name of the model
name: GS101 RESIDENTIAL GAS DETECTOR
# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters.
description: "GS101 is a residential gas detector to detect the natural gas leak and send alarms. When the concentration caused by gas leak reaches the preset threshold, the detector will trigger both LED light alarm and buzzer sound alarm, it also supports controlling outputs to close the gas valve and open the vent fans to prevent potential accidents."
