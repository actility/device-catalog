# Commercial name of the model
name: UC51x Series LoRaWAN® Solenoid Valve Controller
# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters.
description: Milesight UC51x series is a device used to remotely control DC latching solenoids of the valve. It contains 2 solenoid interfaces and 2 GPIO interfaces, which can be easily controlled locally or remotely. Besides ultra-low-power LoRaWAN® technology, UC51x series also provides built-in solar pannel and high-capacity battery power supply for long-term operation. For outdoor applications, it equips with IP67-rated enclosure and M12 connectors to protect from water and dust under harsh environments.
