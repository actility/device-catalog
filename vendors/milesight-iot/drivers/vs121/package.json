  "description": "Milesight VS121, based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, is an AI workplace sensor designed to monitor occupancy & utilization in modern workspace, which can reach up to 95% recognition rate. With the ability to sense from up to more than 78 m2, few sensors are needed to cover the same area, decreasing the deploy costs for users. Only counter values are transmitted over LoRaWAN速 network, which can prevent the privacy concerns. Based on standard LoRaWAN速 protocol, VS121 can work with Milesight LoRaWAN速 gateway and mainstream LoRaWAN速 network servers. With easy installation, VS121 sensor has great use in shops, malls, offices, exhibitions, etc.",
