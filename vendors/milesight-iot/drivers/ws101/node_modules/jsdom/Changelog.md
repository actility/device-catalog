<!-- Style guide:

* Use past tense verbs to start the sentence, e.g. "Fixed", "Added", "Removed", ...
* Each bullet point is a sentence (or more), and so ends with a period.
* Package names are in `code`, sometimes [`linked`]().
* Prefer referring to methods and properties via `someInstance.prop`, instead of `ClassName.prototype.prop`. (Never use `ClassName.prop` except for statics.)
* Refer to attributes via `attr=""`.
* Refer to elements via `<element>`.
* Refer to events via `eventname`.
* Refer to CSS properties via `'propname'`.
* Never use the IDL terms "interface", "attribute", or "operation".
* URL schemes are in `code`, e.g. `data:`.
* Except in the headings, all version numbers get a "v" prefix, e.g. v12.2.0.
* Follow the bullet point with parenthetical GitHub usernames when contributed by a non-core team member, e.g. "Fixed foo. (person)"

Other guidelines:

* Commit messages are primarily for jsdom developers. Changelog entries are primarily for users. Usually you cannot reuse the commit message.
* Sometimes a single commit may expand to multiple changelog entries.
* Do not include commits that have no user-facing impact, e.g. test rolls, refactorings, benchmark additions, etc.
* For regression fixes, note the version in which something regressed.
* Breaking changes get their own section.
* Group in the order "Added", "Removed", "Changed", "Fixed".
* Roughly order changes within those groupings by impact.
-->

## 15.2.1

* Fixed `JSDOM.fromURL()` handling of URLs with hashes in them, to no longer send the hash to the server and append an extra copy of it when constructing the `Document`. (rchl)
* Fixed focusing an already-focused element to correctly do nothing, instead of firing additional `focus` events. (eps1lon)
* Fixed typo in the not-implemented message for `mediaElement.addTextTrack()`. (mtsmfm)
* Upgraded `nwsapi` minimum version to 2.2.0, which fixes issues with `::-webkit-` prefixed pseudo-elements and namespaced attribute selectors.

## 15.2.0

* Added basic style inheritance in `getComputedStyle()` for the `'visibility'` property. This sets the foundation for further work on inheritance, cascading, and specificity. (eps1lon)
* Added `shadowRoot.activeElement`.
* Added `readystatechange` events during document loading.
* Added a stub for `form.requestSubmit()`, to match our existing stub for `form.submit()`.
* Changed `el.tabIndex`'s default value, when no `tabindex=""` attribute was set, to reflect the updated specification.
* Changed the exception thrown by `el.attachShadow()` on something that's already a shadow host, to reflect the updated specification.
* Fixed the validation logic for `<input type="range">`.
* Fixed `selectEl.value` when no `<option>` is selected to return the empty string, instead of the value of the first option. (tgohn)
* Fixed various correctness issues with `new FormData(formElement)`. (brendo)
* Fixed error messages when parsing XML to include the filename, instead of using `"undefined"`. (papandreou)
* Fixed the logic for reflected properties to not be affected by overwriting of `el.getAttributeNS()` or `el.setAttributeNS()`.
* Set `canvas` as an optional ``peerDependency`, which apparently helps with Yarn PnP support.

## 15.1.1

* Moved the `nonce` property from `HTMLScriptElement` and `HTMLStyleElement` to `HTMLElement`. Note that it is still just a simple reflection of the attribute, and has not been updated for the rest of the changes in [whatwg/html#2373](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/2373).
* Fixed the `style` and `on<event>` properties to properly track their related attributes for SVG elements. (kbruneel)
* Fixed `XMLHttpRequest` merging preflight and response headers. (thiagohirata)
* Fixed `XMLHttpRequest` reserializing `content-type` request headers unnecessarily. See [whatwg/mimesniff#84](https://github.com/whatwg/mimesniff/issues/84) for more details. (thiagohirata)
* Fixed `element.tagName` to be the ASCII uppercase of the element's qualified name, instead of the Unicode uppercase.

## 15.1.0

* Added the `Headers` class from the Fetch standard.
* Added the `element.translate` getter and setter.
* Fixed synchronous `XMLHttpRequest` on the newly-released Node.js v12.
* Fixed `form.elements` to exclude `<input type="image">` elements.
* Fixed event path iteration in shadow DOM cases, following spec fixes at [whatwg/dom#686](https://github.com/whatwg/dom/pull/686) and [whatwg/dom#750](https://github.com/whatwg/dom/pull/750).
* Fixed `pattern=""` form control validation to apply the given regular expression to the whole string. (kontomondo)

## 15.0.0

Several potentially-breaking changes, each of them fairly unlikely to actually break anything:

* `JSDOM.fromFile()` now treats `.xht` files as `application/xhtml+xml`, the same as it does for `.xhtml` and `.xml`. Previously, it would treat them as `text/html`.
* If the `JSDOM` constructor's `contentType` option has a `charset` parameter, and the first argument to the constructor is a binary data type (e.g. `Buffer` or `ArrayBuffer`), then the `charset` will override any sniffed encoding in the same way as a `Content-Type` header would in browser scenarios. Previously, the `charset` parameter was ignored.
* When using the `Blob` or `File` constructor with the `endings: "native"` option, jsdom will now convert line endings to `\n` on all operating systems, for consistency. Previously, on Windows, it would convert line endings to `\r\n`.

## 14.1.0

* Added activation behavior for `<a>` and `<area>` elements whose `href=""` points to a `javascript:` URL or fragment.
* Added the `<datalist>` element's `options` property.
* Added the `<input>` element's `list` property.
* Added `PageTransitionEvent`, and the firing of `pageshow` events during loading.
* Exposed the `External` class as a property of `window`.
* Fixed HTML fragment parsing (via `innerHTML` and `outerHTML`) to be spec-compliant. (pmdartus)
* Fixed HTML serialization (e.g. via `innerHTML`) breaking after setting certain properties to non-string values.
* Fixed how disabling an element would cause its activation behavior to forever be null, even if it were re-enabled.
* Fixed all access to attributes to ignore attributes with namespaces, per the spec.
* Fixed `<style>`s to no longer apply to documents without a browsing context. This includes fixing a crash that would occur with such styles if they had an `@import` rule.
* Fixed `<option>`'s `label` and `value` properties to return correct values in various edge cases.
* Fixed the `load` event during document loading to target the `Document`, not the `Window`.
* Fixed the `pretendToBeVisual` option to propagate to child subframes, as well as the main `Window`. (pyrho)
* Updated the minimum [`nwsapi`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nwsapi) version from v2.1.1 to v2.1.3, bringing along a few fixes in our selector engine.

## 14.0.0

Breaking changes:

* `JSDOM.fragment()` now creates fragments whose document has no [browsing context](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#concept-document-bc), i.e. no associated `Window`. This means the `defaultView` property will be null, resources will not load, etc.
* `JSDOM.fragment()`, called with no arguments, now creates a `DocumentFragment` with no children, instead of with a single child text node whose data was `"undefined"`.

Other changes:

* Fixed a regression in v13.2.0 when calling `element.blur()` on a focused element.
* Fixed inserting `<link>` elements into documents with no browsing context to no longer crash if the originating `JSDOM` was configured to fetch the resource. Now, per spec, `<link>` elements only attempt to fetch if they are browsing-context connected.
* Fixed `<template>` elements to have the correct semantics, of using a separate browsing-context-less document to store its contents. In particular this means resources will not be fetched for elements inside the `<template>`, as per spec.

## 13.2.0

* Added support for `MutationObserver`s! (pmdartus)
* Added support for XML documents loaded in frames and iframes; previously this would error.
* Added the `<progress>` element's `value`, `max`, and `position` properties.
* Added `navigator.plugins` and `navigator.mimeTypes`. (But, they are always empty.)
* Fixed `<summary>` elements respond to `click` events by toggling their parent `<details>`.
* Fixed `<summary>` elements to be focusable.
* Fixed XML document DOCTYPE parsing to preserve any custom name values.
* Fixed XML documents to default to UTF-8, not windows-1252 like HTML documents do.
* Fixed all events fired by jsdom to have `isTrusted` set to `true`.
* Fixed `DOMParser`-created documents to have their `readyState` set to `"complete"`.
* Fixed how nested `<fieldset>`s get disabled.
* Fixed `getComputedStyle()` to throw a sensible exception when passed the wrong argument, instead of one that exposes jsdom internals.
* Upgraded our [`saxes`](https://github.com/lddubeau/saxes) dependency, so that it now correctly errors on XML fragments like `<foo bar:="1"/>`.

## 13.1.0

* Added `el.insertAdjacentElement()` and `el.insertAdjacentText()`.
* Added the firing of a cancelable `reset` event to `form.reset()`. (epfremmer)
* Added the `type`, `value`, and `defaultValue` properties to `<output>` elements, including their form reset behavior. (epfremmer)
* Added the `outputEl.htmlFor` property.
* Fixed the performance of parsing large text nodes, particularly noticeable for large inline `<style>` or `<script>` elements. This regressed in v11.6.0. To learn more, see [V8 issue #6730](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=6730#c4).
* Fixed the `style` property on `<a>` and `<area>` elements. This regressed in v13.0.0.
* Fixed `node.isConnected` to not always return false for nodes inside a shadow tree. (pmdartus)
* Fixed `<button type="reset">` and `<input type="reset">` elements to actually perform a form reset when clicked, instead of doing nothing. (epfremmer)
* Fixed `el.setCustomValidity()` for `<output>` and `<fieldset>`.
* Fixed activation behavior when dispatching bubbling `click` events, so that for example calling `el.click()` on the child of a submit button element will submit the form.
* Fixed our XML parsing code to ignore text outside the root element, instead of treating it as an error. (lddubeau)
* Fixed XML serialization when elements had an unknown prefix.
* Fixed radio button group name matching to be case-sensitive, per [a spec update](https://github.com/whatwg/html/commit/6acdb2122298d2bb7bb839c0a61b4e1f9b0f9bc9).
* Fixed `focus`/`blur` events to be composed.
* Fixed `mediaElement.duration` to default to `NaN`.
* Fixed `olEl.start` to default to `1`.
* Fixed using `XMLHttpRequest` against non-existant `file:` URLs to treat that as a network error, instead of crashing. (pascalbayer) Note that in the future we may completely disable `XMLHttpRequest` usage against `file:` URLs to follow the browser security model.
* Fixed `document.title` in SVG documents.
* Fixed `titleElement.text` to return the child text content, instead of being the same as `titleElement.innerHTML`.
* Fixed `<textarea>`s to properly account for child CDATA section nodes changing.
* Fixed the value of `Element.prototype[Symbol.unscopables]`.

## 13.0.0

Breaking change:

* Removed support for v1.x of the [`canvas`](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) package, in favor of v2.x. This also removes support for `canvas-prebuilt`, since `canvas` v2.x has a built-in prebuilt version.

Other changes:

* Added proper XML serialization, based on the [`w3c-xmlserializer`](https://github.com/jsdom/w3c-xmlserializer) package. Previously we were just using the HTML serialization, even in XML documents.
* Added the `storageEvent.initStorageEvent()` method.
* Added support for the `passive` option to `addEventListener()`.
* Added the `relList` property to `<a>`, `<area>`, and `<link>` elements.
* Fixed our implementation of the node tree modification constraints (for example the [ensure pre-insertion validity](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-ensure-pre-insertion-validity) algorithm). It is no longer possible to add, remove, or move nodes to create impossible DOM trees. (pmdartus)

## 12.2.0

* Added support for shadow DOM! This includes shadow roots, slots, composed events, and more. (pmdartus)
* Added the `element.toggleAttribute()` method.
* Fixed `XMLHttpRequest` sometimes sending an empty request body after a preflight request. (andreasf)
* Fixed the `formElement.form` property to use an algorithm that also checks the `form=""` attribute, instead of always looking for the closest ancestor `<form>` element. (jamietre)
* Stopped swallowing errors when the `canvas` or `canvas-prebuilt` packages were installed, but failed to load. (joscha)

## 12.1.0

* Dramatically upgraded our XML parser, from the unmaintained [`sax`](https://github.com/isaacs/sax-js) package to the well-maintained [`saxes`](https://github.com/lddubeau/saxes) replacement. This increases our specification conformance, including rejecting certain ill-formed XML documents that were previously accepted, and properly handling other constructs like empty comments, CDATA sections, and `<script>` elements. (lddubeau)
* Added `fieldsetEl.elements` and `fieldsetEl.type` properties.
* Added the `options` parameter to `dom.runVMScript()`. (SimenB)
* Added the ability for custom resource loader `fetch()` implementations to see what element initiated the fetch. (sarvaje)
* Fixed `input` and `change` events for `<input>` elements to be trusted and uncancelable.
* "Fixed" `<script>`s with the `async` attribute to not execute before sync `<script>`s that precede them. We still do not, in general, have proper execution of scripts during the initial parsing of a document, so this fix is more of a reduction of badness than an alignment with the specification. This behavior regressed in v12.0.0. (sarvaje)

## 12.0.0

This major release brings along our [new resource loader API](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom#loading-subresources), finally bringing all the capabilities from jsdom v9 to the new (jsdom v10+) API. Thanks very much to [@sarvaje](https://github.com/sarvaje) for his work to make this possible!

Breaking changes:

* jsdom now requires Node.js v8.
* Removed the old jsdom API, as the new API now has all the capabilities you need.
* Updated our [`parse5`](https://github.com/inikulin/parse5/) dependency to v5, which changes the format of the node locations returned by `dom.nodeLocation()`.
* Updated our [`whatwg-url`](https://github.com/jsdom/whatwg-url) dependency to v7, which changes the origin of `file:` URLs to be an opaque origin (and thus `file:` URLs are no longer same origin to each other).

Other changes:

* Added `countReset()`, `dir()` and `dirxml()` methods to `console`.
* Added the `InputEvent` class.
* Added `window.status`.
* Added `htmlElement.draggable`.
* Fixed `window.frameElement` to correctly return an actual `HTMLElement` instance, instead of a jsdom internal class.
* Fixed cloning of `textarea` elements to preserve their values.
* Fixed `select.selectedOptions` sometimes returning outdated results.
* Fixed CSS selection APIs sometimes returning outdated results, especially for state pseudo-class selectors like `:checked`.
* Fixed CSS selection APIs to throw an error for invalid selectors even when used on empty nodes.
* Fixed `window.name` to default to the empty string, per spec, instead of `"nodejs"`.
* Fixed the default User-Agent to say "unknown OS" instead of "undefined" when jsdom is used in web browsers.

## 11.12.0

* Added `window.localStorage`, `window.sessionStorage`, and `StorageEvent` support. These are currently only stored in-memory; file an issue if you need persistent (on-disk) storage capability so we can discuss adding that. This feature includes the new `storageQuota` option for controlling how much can be stored.
* Added `element.closest()`. (caub)
* Changed `hashchange` and `popstate` events to no longer bubble, per a specification update.
* Fixed the old API in Node.js v10 to not throw, when given input that is not a valid file path (such as a typical HTML string).
* Upgraded `cssstyle` to v1.0.0, bringing along various fixes to our CSS parser and object model. (eddies)
* Upgraded `nwsapi` to v2.0.7, bringing along various fixes to our selector engine.

## 11.11.0

* Added `node.getRootNode()`. (FrecksterGIT)
* Added `label.control`. (FrecksterGIT)
* Added `el.labels` for form control elements. (FrecksterGIT)
* Fixed the `contentType` of `Document`s created through `<iframe>`s.
* Fixed the `contentType` and `origin` of `Document`s created through `document.implementation.createDocument()`.
* Fixed `sourceEl.srcset` to return the value of the `srcset=""` attribute, instead of the `cite=""` attribute.
* Fixed `node.normalize()` to not modify non-`Text` nodes. (lddubeau)
* Upgraded `cssstyle` to v0.3.1, bringing along various fixes to our CSS parser and object model. (jsakas)
* Upgraded `whatwg-url` to v6.4.1, fixing the interaction of `URL`'s `href` and `searchParams` properties.
* Upgraded our selector matching engine from `nwsmatcher` to `nwsapi`, bringing along extensive fixes, performance improvements, and additional selector support.

## 11.10.0

* Added `event.srcElement` and `event.returnValue`.
* Fixed `XMLHttpRequest` to correctly set the User-Agent header, and set it on CORS preflight requests. (BehindTheMath)

## 11.9.0

* Added `node.lookupPrefix()`, `node.lookupNamespaceURI()` and `node.isDefaultNamespace()`.
* Fixed the cloning of `Document`s; previously it would not clone all of the appropriate state, and would sometimes add an extra document type node.
* Fixed various edge cases in the `textContent` and `nodeValue` properties.
* Fixed `canvas.toBlob()` to properly pass through the JPEG quality argument, instead of always passing zero to `node-canvas`. (challakoushik)

## 11.8.0

* Added the full constraint validation API, i.e. `willValidate`, `validity`, `validationMessage`, `checkValidity()`, `reportValidity()`, and `setCustomValidity()`, on `HTMLButtonElement`, `HTMLFieldSetElement`, `HTMLFormElement`, `HTMLInputElement`, `HTMLObjectElement`, `HTMLOutputElement`, `HTMLSelectElement`, and `HTMLTextAreaElement`. (kontomondo)
* Added `getElementById()` to `DocumentFragment`.

## 11.7.0

* Added the boolean return value to `DOMTokenList`'s `replace()` method, per the recent spec addition.
* Added `FileReader`'s `readAsBinaryString()` method, as it has been added back to the specification.
* Fixed event handlers to be own properties of each `Window`, instead of on `Window.prototype`. (Fetz)
* Fixed an exception that would sometimes get raised when removing an `<img>` element's `src=""` attribute. (atsikov)
* Fixed `abort` events on `AbortSignal`s to have their `isTrusted` set to true.
* Fixed some argument conversions in `XMLHttpRequest`'s `open()` method.
* Improved MIME type and `data:` URL parsing throughout jsdom, by using the new [`whatwg-mimetype`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/whatwg-mimetype) and [`data-urls`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/data-urls) packages.
* Removed some unnecessary `.webidl` files that were included in the npm package.

## 11.6.2

* Fixed another regression (since v11.6.0) in `<style>` elements, where they would omit a series of parsing `jsdomError` events for any style sheet text containing spaces.
* Generally improved the spec-conformance of when `<style>` and `<script>` elements are evaluated; for example, `<script>` elements inserted by `innerHTML` are no longer evaluated.

## 11.6.1

* Fixed one regression (since v11.6.0) in `<style>` elements, where their `sheet` property would sometimes be `null` when it should not be.
* Fixed a case where a `<style>` element's `sheet` property would be left as a `CSSStyleSheet` despite it not being in the document.

Another regression remains where we are emitting spurious CSS-parsing `jsdomError` events; see [#2123](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/2123). We also discovered a large amount of preexisting brokenness around `<style>`, `<link>`, and `@import`; see [#2124](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/2124) for more details.

We'll try to fix these soon, especially the regression.

## 11.6.0

* Added a fully-functioning `WebSocket` implementation!
* Added a `window.performance` implementation, including the basics of the [High Resolution Time](https://w3c.github.io/hr-time/) specification: `performance.now()`, `performance.timeOrigin`, and `performance.toJSON()`.
* Added support for all of the public API of `HTMLMeterElement`, except for `meterEl.labels`.
* Added the `locationbar`, `menubar`, `personalbar`, `scrollbars`, `statusbar`, and `toolbar` properties to `Window`.
* Added more properties to `window.screen`: `availWidth`, `availHeight`, `colorDepth`, and `pixelDepth`. All of its properties are now getters as well.
* Added `window.devicePixelRatio`.
* Added `getModifierState()` to `MouseEvent` and `KeyboardEvent`.
* Added a setter for `HTMLInputElement`'s `files` property.
* Added support for the `endings` option to the `Blob` constructor.
* Fixed firing various event firings to have the correct default values, e.g. the properties of `MouseEvent` when using `element.click()`.
* Fixed the firing of `popstate` and `hashchange` events during fragment navigation to make them trusted events.
* Fixed `data:` URL parsing to not include the fragment portions.
* Fixed all URL-accepting properties to properly perform [scalar value string conversion](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#javascript-string-convert) and URL resolution.
* Fixed many other small edge-case conformance issues in the API surface of various web APIs; see [#2053](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/pull/2053) and [#2081](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/pull/2081) for more information.
* Fixed various APIs to use ASCII lowercasing, instead of Unicode lowercasing, for element and attribute names.
* Fixed the encoding of a document created via `new Document()` to be UTF-8.
* Fixed event handler properties behavior when given non-callable objects.
* Increased the performance of parsing HTML documents with large numbers of sibling elements.
* Removed `probablySupportsContext()` and `setContext()` from `HTMLCanvasElement`, per spec updates.
* Removed the nonstandard `window.scrollLeft` and `window.scrollTop` properties, and the `window.createPopup()` method.

## 11.5.1

(This should have been a minor release; oops.)

* Added `AbortSignal` and `AbortController`.
* Fixed validation for file `<input>`s and implemented validation for more input types.

## 11.4.0

For this release we'd like to welcome [@Zirro](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/commits?author=Zirro) to the core team; his contributions over the course of this year have enhanced jsdom immensely.

* Added a rudimentary set of SVG element classes, namely `SVGElement`, `SVGGraphicsElement`, `SVGSVGElement`, `SVGTests`, `SVGAnimatedString`, `SVGNumber`, and `SVGStringList`. The main impact here is that SVG elements are now instances of `SVGElement`, instead of being simply `Element` (as they were in v11.3.0) or `HTMLUnknownElement` (as they were in v11.2.0 and previously). The only concrete subclass that is implemented is `SVGSVGElement`, for `<svg>` itself; other tags will not map to their correct classes, because those classes are not yet implemented.
* Added the new `pretendToBeVisual` option, which controls the presence of the new `requestAnimationFrame()` and `cancelAnimationFrame()` methods, and the new values of `document.hidden`/`document.visibilityState`. [See the README](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom#pretending-to-be-a-visual-browser) for more information. (SimenB)
* Added the `append()` and `prepend()` methods to `Document`, `DocumentFragment`, and `Element`. (caub)
* Added the `before()`, `after()`, and `replaceWith()` methods to `DocumentType`, `Element`, and `CharacterData`. (caub)
* Added `node.isConnected`.
* Added `node.isSameNode()`.
* Added support for parsing CDATA sections in XML documents, including in `domParser.parseFromString()`. (myabc)
* Added appropriate `input.value` getter/setter logic for `<input type="file">`.
* Significantly improved the spec-compliance of `NamedNodeMap`, i.e. of `element.attributes`, such that retrieving named or indexed properties will now always work properly.
* Fixed `domParser.parseFromString()` to not parse HTML character entities in XML documents. (myabc)
* Fixed `xhr.abort()` to clear any set headers.
* Fixed `XMLHttpRequest` to always decoded responses as UTF-8 when `responseType` is set to `"json"`.
* Fixed `XMLHttpRequest` CORS header handling, especially with regard to preflights and Access-Control-Allow-Headers. (ScottAlbertine)
* Fixed the behavior of `radioButton.click()` to fire appropriate `input` and `change` events. (liqwid)
* Fixed `querySelector()`/`querySelectorAll()` behavior for SVG elements inside `<template>` contents `DocumentFragment`s, including those created by `JSDOM.fragment()`. (caub)
* Fixed the line number reporting in exception stack traces when using `<script>` elements, when `includeNodeLocations` is set.
* Removed the `<applet>` element, [following the spec](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/1399).

## 11.3.0

For this release we'd like to formally welcome [@TimothyGu](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/commits?author=TimothyGu) to the core team, as a prolific contributor. He will join the illustrious ranks of those who do so much work on jsdom that we no longer note their names in the changelog.

* Added `table.tHead`, `table.tFoot`, and `table.caption` setters, and the `table.createTBody()` method.
* Added `CompositionEvent` and `WheelEvent` classes.
* Added a `<details>` element implementation. (Zirro)
* Added stub `<marquee>` and `<picture>` element implementations. (Zirro)
* Updated `uiEvent.initUIEvent()`, `keyboardEvent.initKeyboardEvent()`, and `mouseEvent.initiMouseEvent()` to match the latest specifications.
* Converted `DOMTokenList` (used by, e.g., `element.classList`) to use proxies for improved specification compliance and "liveness".
* Fixed the `DOMException` class to be spec-compliant, including its constructor signature.
* Fixed some subtle interactions between inline event handlers and other event listeners.
* Fixed the element interface used when creating many of the more obscure elements.
* Fixed the behavior of the `table.rows` getter, and the `table.createCaption()` and `table.deleteRow()` methods.
* Fixed incorrect sharing of methods between interfaces that used mixins (e.g. previously `document.querySelector === documentFragment.querySelector`, incorrectly).
* Fixed `FocusEvent` creation, which regressed in v11.2.0.
* Fixed `UIEvent` to only allow initializing with `Window` objects for its `view` property.
* Fixed the behavior of `tr.rowIndex` and `tr.deleteCall()`.
* Fixed the element interface for `<td>` and `<th>` to be simply `HTMLTableCellElement`, and improved that class's spec compliance.
* Fixed calling `label.click()` to not trigger the labeled control's activation behavior when the control is disabled. (schreifels)
* Fixed `document.getElementsByName()` to return a `NodeList` instead of a `HTMLCollection`. (Zirro)
* Significantly sped up synchronous `XMLHttpRequest`. (Zirro)

## 11.2.0

This release brings with it a much-awaited infrastructure change, as part of [webidl2js v7.3.0](https://github.com/jsdom/webidl2js/releases/tag/v7.3.0) by the ever-amazing TimothyGu: jsdom can now generate spec-compliant versions of classes that have "`Proxy`-like" behavior, i.e. allow getting or setting keys in unusual ways.
