# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters. 
description: "The MerryIoT Open/Close fits into any interior design and is easy to install. It is composed of two parts. The main body contains the active electronics to measure magnetic fields and transmit data, if any changes, to a LoRaWAN network. The other part is a permanent magnet of sufficient field strength to be detected by the Hall-Effect sensor on the main body. Built-in 3-axis Accelerometer, allows detection of abnormal movement from the window or door, enhance security measures."
