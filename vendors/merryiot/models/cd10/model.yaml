# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters. 
description: "Browan's new MerryIoT range of LoRaWAN sensors includes this compact but high-performance CO2 sensor. The sensor measures Temperature, Humidity and CO2. Using an NDIR (Nondispersive Infrared) CO2 sensor, the device gives very accurate CO2 readings. The sensor features red/yellow/green LED CO2 level indication, and includes a buzzer to warn users of high CO2 levels. Cleverly, the LED indication is triggered when users wave a hand over the unit using a proximity detector. This reduces power usage so the included 3.6V Lithium batteries should power the sensor for around two years."
