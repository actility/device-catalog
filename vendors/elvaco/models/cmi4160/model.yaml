# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters.
description: With the CMi4160, Elvaco offers a meter communication module that has been specially developed as an easy-to-use and cost-effective solution for transmitting data from the heat meter Diehl Metering SHARKY 775 to a receiving server. The device is mounted internally in the meter and works on the basis of the IoT technology LoRaWAN. The internal Meter Connectivity Module (MCM) is characterized by a long battery life of 11 years, high energy efficiency and a long communication range. Last but not least, the CMi4160 can easily be retrofitted into already installed meters.
