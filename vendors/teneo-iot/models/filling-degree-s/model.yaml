# Commercial name of the model 
name: Filling Degree Sensor
# Functional description of the product. Maximum 500 characters. 
description: "The Teneo IoT Filling Degree Sensor is a LoRaWAN® waste bin management solution that combines a fillgrade laser sensor that measures the distance to the waste and a GPS receiver to obtain the location of the waste bin. The distance data (from the sensor to the top of the waste) will be sent to the LoRaWAN® network and an online dashboard can be used to display the location of the waste bins."
