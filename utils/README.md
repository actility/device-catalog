# UTILS

## Introduction
In this folder, you can find a handful of functions and files to help creating drivers and other items.

Here is the list of available tools:
* checkShema.js


## Check Schema (checkSchema.js)
This file helps to verify that the examples all conform to uplink.schema.json and downlink.schema.json
For now, you copy-paste this file into the driver folder to use.
Then run ```node checkSchema.js```.
